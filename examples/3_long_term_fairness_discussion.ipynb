    "# Discussion\n",
    "The goal of this project is, to provide a framework to explore the effects of different decision rules in dynamic fairness scenarios and point out possible shortcomings. The main example is, that the same decision rule can have different impact depending on the underlying data dynamics. Assuming effects of positive decisions on the whole group, disparate impact converges towards the optimal solution. When decisions have only an impact on individual level, disparate impact only helps those individuals with positive decision and stabilizes this inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, only positive decisions had an impact on the dynamics. This is because the negative prediction was 0 and did not count negative in the sum. This is not really realistic and would change the results again. However, the current implementation of the data generators is imperfect and negative labels made the models collapse. An improved data generation scheme with more considerations is therefore discussed in the next part."

    "One assumption in the previous data generators was, that every individual could benefit from positive decisions. In other words, every individual could be positive labeled. This must not always be the case and, furthermore, negative decisions should also have an impact on the dynamics. Finally, only whole groups or individuals benefit from positive decisions. This should be extended to subpopulations of each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be modeled using a more complex model with a hidden variable $h$ representing the level  of capability of each individual. Individuals would then benefit from positive decisions depending on the level of their hidden capability $h$. Furthermore, the distance in feature space to individuals with positive prediction should define how much an individual benefits from positive decisions of others. \n",

    "Measuring fairness in the dynamic setup is not straight forward. The method used in this project, counting the number of positive labeled individuals in the future, is not sufficient. The decision maker could again prefer certain groups and improve their capabilities before others. For instance assume, that capabilities increase continuously (i.e. there is no upper bound for qualification). In this case, individuals who entered the positive group earlier have an advantage.\n",
