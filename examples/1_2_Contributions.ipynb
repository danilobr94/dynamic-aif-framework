    "# 2 Motivation\n",
    "With the knowledge about the data generation process, it is possible to estimate the long term effect of a decision rule without the data generation and baseline estimation process. However, the data generation process is assumed (and usually) unknown and even the baseline data generation process is not available in practice.\n",

    "Ultimately, a decision rule in this framework would incorporate knowledge about the sequential data generation and try to learn relationships.\n",
